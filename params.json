This way all players will be registered on the website/forum, which enables you to do many things, such as keeping track of all players and staff, giving easy help to players who need it, and much more.\r\n\r\n# How does it work?\r\n\r\nWell SAM stands for \"Simple Authorization Mechanism\". How it works is really advanced and complex. To put it simply, SAM connects with both your Pocketmine server and your web server, that you enter in the config file.\r\n\r\n# How do I use it?\r\n\r\nIt's very simple. First, as with all pocketmine plugins, put it in your plugins folder and restart your server. Than edit the config file to your preferences, including the domain of the website/forum you want to use. Than restart the server. When anyone first joins the'll see this message: \"This server uses SAM by Edwardthedog2. You must register at (your sites domain) to play.\" The \"your sites domain\" will change to the domain name of whatever website you choose. All the player has to do than is go to your website/forums, signup, than go back to your server and type \"/login (user's password)\". That's all there is to it.\r\n\r\n# Is SAM a good auth plugin for all servers?\r\n\r\nNo. SAM is only good for the servers it's intended for. Specifically, servers that have a site, that have enough storage space to hold all profiles, and whose owners/staff want to keep track of all players, and can benifit from this plugin.\r\n\r\n# Sounds cool to me. Is it ready for use?\r\n\r\nNot at all. It's still in heavy development stage. If you want to contribute, that would be great, as long as you follow along.\r\n\r\n# Do you have any help in creating this?\r\n\r\nYes, lots! I had much help from HotFireyDeath, wolfdale, and HittmanA from the Pocketmine forums. Without their help I'd be way confused right now.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
