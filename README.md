# SAM
An auth plugin for Pocketmine-MP that connects to a website.

# What is it?

SAM is an auth plugin for PocketMine-MP that forces all players to register at the server's website before they can play. This way all players will be registered on the website/forum, which enables you to do many things. Such as: keep track of all players and staff, give easy help to players who need it, and much more.

# How does it work?

Well SAM stands for "Simple Authorization Mechanism". How it works is really advanced and complex. to put it simple, SAM connects with both your Pocketmine server and your web server, that you enter in the config file.

# Is SAM a good auth plugin for all servers?

No. SAM is only good for the servers it's intended for. Specifically, servers that have a site, that has enough storage space to hold all profiles, and whose owners/staff want to keep track of all players, and can benifit from this plugin.

# Sounds cool to me. Is it ready for use?

Not at all. It's still in heavy development stage. If you want to contribute, that would be great, as long as you follow along.
